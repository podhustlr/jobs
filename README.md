# Work @ Podhustlr

If you're interested in working at Podhustlr we have the following openings.

## Jobs

 - [Interface Engineer](open/interface-engineer.md)
 - [Full Stack Developer](open/full-stack-developer.md)
 - [ML Engineer (Audio)](open/ml-engineer.md)


## What are we looking for

#### Competitors

People who have done well at math competitions (USAMO, IMO, PUTNAM), competition programming (ACM, USACO, codejam, topcoder), science fairs (ISEF, STS), or capture the flag (DEFCON, secuinside, GITS). Those competitions don't just select for ability, they also select for quickness. We are in a very competitive space.

#### Contributors

You like to write code. It doesn't matter if it's for a product that you never shipped or for an open source project. Show us your GitHub. You got stars? Are you a grinder and your profile is all green?

#### Architects

It's going to get messy and it's going to get bloody in the early stages. People have to be able to design good APIs and source layouts on the first try. It doesn't have to follow industry standards, as far as it's clean and maintainable. Programming is not the process of writing computer code so that machines can understand it but rather writing code that's readable for other humans.

## Why

Honesty is one of Podhustlr's core values. So, let's get something straight. Podhustlr is not a tech company. It's a platform company, meaning we are developing a platform using technology. That said, we are going to make sure that we make the best platform for podcasting there is.

Podcasting is one of the most subtle forms of media production and consumption. In a world of continuous visual bombardment podcasting is the only information stream that requires putting your brain to work and concentrating to a voice, stimulating your neurons to create visual representations of what you are listening to. It's a non-blocking, non-intrusive and rythmic way of entertaining and informing yourself.

Spotify announced that it wants to focus on the audio creator economy (aka podcasts) and make itself a $100B ARR company. The market is blooming and it's moving fast. If you want to move fast, fail early and iterate over and over, you can find a place here.



## The challenge

All positions are full time and completely remote. If you think youâ€™re a good fit, e-mail us: work at podhustlr.com. If you include a good solution to our programming challenge in your e-mail, we'll take you much more seriously.

After a programming challenge, we'll do a phone screen and if that goes well, you'll meet the team and work on a real problem in our real codebase for a few days (paid). If you and the team all agree that you should definitely join us, then welcome to Podhustlr.



## Benefits

- Health, dental, and vision insurance
- Flexible time off
- PTO
- Hardware you may need
- Get paid more than the founder ( > industry standard for your role)
- Stock plan
- Beat Spotify in the creator's space
